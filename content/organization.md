Organization is one of the hardest things to do in any group bigger than can
fit at your dining table.  When 30, 50, or 150 people show up at your meeting,
what do you do?  How do you leverage the combined power of the people in that
room?

At Indivisible Harvard, we're lucky to have the services of a couple of
professional group facilitators, which has allowed us to set up a useful
organization in very little time.  It also makes our meetings run smoothly and
quickly.
