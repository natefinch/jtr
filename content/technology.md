Technology is the part that can be either quite easy, if you have a tech guru on
your team, or particularly difficult, if your computer skills don't go much
beyond email and reading the latest news.

This subject is fairly easy to search the internet for.  Want to know how to set
up a Wordpress website?  There's literally a million webpages describing exactly
how to do it.  At JoinTheResistance, we're not going to focus on the precise
how-to (though we may link you to particularly good resources), but we'll
instead try to explain why you should make a particular choice, and explain the
best way to configure a piece of technology to benefit your group.

This guide is aimed at smallish groups with limited budgets and limited
technical talent.  If you have a large budget and/or a large team who can work
on technical projects (more than 3 people working in their free time), you may
want to make other choices.  Then again, these choices scale relatively well up
to medium-sized organizations.

* <a href="#social-media">Using Social Media</a> 

Social media is essential, and is where many if not most groups will have their
start.

* <a href="#email-lists">Creating Email Lists</a>

Not everyone is on Facebook, believe it or not.  But everyone has email.  This
is an essential tool for communicating with your group.

* <a href="#webpage">Setting Up A Webpage</a>

A webpage is an essential tool for establishing an online presence, and it
should be one of the first things you work on after setting up social media and
an email list.
