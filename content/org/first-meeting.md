An agenda for your first meeting is <a

Don't try to do too much in your first meeting.  If you can get people talking
in groups, that's great.

If your group is more than 10 or so people, skip the "go around the room and
introduce yourself" bit.  It just takes too long with that many people.  Let
people do that in their issue groups.
