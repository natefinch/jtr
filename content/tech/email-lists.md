At Indivisible Harvard, we use Mailchimp for blast email communication, and it
works very well.  It's easy to set up a mailing list, easy to let people sign up
on their own, easy to make nice looking blast emails, and track who has opened
them and who hasn't.

To push information from our single source of truth (the <a
href="#webpage">webpage</a>), we use an <a
href="https://mailchimp.com/resources/guides/mailchimp-for-bloggers/html/#section-set-up-an-rss-campaign"
target="_blank" >RSS Feed campaign</a> in Mailchimp to automatically look for
new posts on Wordpress and send out updates every day.  This is is a pain free
way to make sure that posts on the website get to everyone.

In theory you could set up multiple email lists, each one subscribed to a
different RSS feed based on categories.  This is a great way for people to
tailor what they want to receive in email based on the issues that are important
to them.  

I highly recommend making an "Actions" email list that will receive actions for
your group to act on.  This is a good addiiton to more high tech ways to push
out actions, since email is the great equalizer - everyone has email.
