This site began as a way for organizers from <a
href="https://indivisibleharvard.org" target="_blank">Indivisible Harvard</a> to share their
experience in organizating and technology, to help other similar groups hit the
ground running.  They bring together decades of computer programming experience
with decades of group facilitation and organization experience.

This key mix is crucial for making small to medium sized political action
groups successful.
